The ICE is a repository that was created as a learning opportunity and a place to develop technical writing skills. It was a fun experience to create this project and it provided excellent insight into the software development process. However, at this moment, there are no plans to continue further development on this project.

# ICE - Ideal Calculation Engine
## Description
ICE is a software model designed to calculate optimal output values. It supports importing data from Excel or CSV files. The mathematical model created in ICE can be built regardless of the number of input values.

## Features
• Importing Data: ICE supports importing data from Excel or CSV files. Users can specify both filename and filename with extension. The prompt for entering values is generated from column names in the Excel file. The software automatically recognizes the supported file extension and allows users to input filenames without the file extension. Empty rows with incomplete data are automatically detected and excluded from the mathematical model.

• Time-based Calculation: ICE allows users to create a mathematical model with data indicated by the hour or day of the week. This provides flexibility in analyzing data based on time-based criteria.
